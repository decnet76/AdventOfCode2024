Advent of Code 2024 - Private Leaderboard Version 1

NOTE: rubbish code, I am still learning Python

3/12/2024:
Redone the README file (lost in the sync between Github and Replit)
Added an AoC Chrome extension to show the private leaderboard by day and other cool charts

TO DO:
- add execution time for code (like other colleagues are doing); simple problems so far until day 3 so efficiency is not an issue, but in AoC2023 there were some that were running very slowly due to my poor iterative algorithms
- it may be interesting to estimate the O(n) too

5/12/2024:
- Replit tells me that I have used all the development time for the free account, so I have to move to a different setup. No time today to install and configure tools, I may have to skip this Day5
